Gesture Classification Model
----------------------------

This project attempts to classify human gestures based on time series data from accelerometers, gyroscopes, and electromyography (EGM) sensors.

The model takes sequences of sensor readings as input and outputs an integer class label (0â€“9), representing different gestures.

Built with TensorFlow and trained on ~1.1M labeled time series samples.
